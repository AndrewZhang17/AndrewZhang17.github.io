I am a CS Master's student at [UCSB](https://cs.ucsb.edu/){:target="_blank"} with a focus on Augmented Reality.

Currently, I am a SWE intern at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"} on the [MyAnalytics](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/myanalytics-personal-analytics){:target="_blank"} team.
Previously, I was an intern at [NASA JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/){:target="_blank"}, working on [OnSight](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4451){:target="_blank"} in the [OpsLab](https://opslab.jpl.nasa.gov/){:target="_blank"}.
