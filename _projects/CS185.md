This is a website I created using React for an HCI class project. It showcases some images and videos, as well as a website message board. There is also a movie database using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/){:target="_blank"} and movie data visualization using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/){:target="_blank"}.
