My partner and I analyzed the Python garbage collector for a class project. We profiled and compared [CPython's](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} and [PyPy's](https://www.pypy.org/){:target="_blank"} garbage collectors on different benchmarks to determine their strengths and weaknesses. We also created a custom visualizer to see the effects of changing garbage collector parameters on collection time.
