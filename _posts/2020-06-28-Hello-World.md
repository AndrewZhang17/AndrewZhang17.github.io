Thanks for visiting my site, and welcome to my first blog post! This is a place where I will ramble about things that I want to talk about.

I have never blogged before so this should be interesting. I actually strongly disliked writing in school, so I probably won't edit any of my posts (look out for hecka typos and grammatical errors). Given that we are all stuck inside due to this global pandemic, I might as well find something new to do. Some people decided to start baking bread or do home workouts. I have decided I will create a website and start a blog. 

I don't have a detailed plan of how this will go. I don't have a posting schedule planned, but for now I will probably try to post something new every week or two. I also don't have too many topics in mind, so each new post could be some sort of stream of consciousness and this blog would be more similar to a journal. If you have some topic that you would like to hear my thoughts on, feel free to contact me!

I have been spending this quarantine arc of 2020 doing some socially distant activities. I'm pretty frustrated at the people who are ignoring the safety measures put in place since I really want to go back out into the world. I made one of those rebounding tennis balls with a cinder block and bungee cord to play tennis by myself. It kept breaking since I had to poke a hole to attach the ball, which would get bigger with every hit. I wish I could go out and play tennis regularly again. I was supposed to go to Florida in April for USTA TOC nationals with UCSB Club Tennis:[ One thing I have enjoyed is playing piano more. I learned how to play Ludovico Einaudi's "Nuvole Bianche" and Yiruma's "River Flows in You". 

I also just started a virtual internship at Microsoft as a SWE intern. I have mostly been going through onboarding material and other training for the first week. My mentor has been super helpful so far, answering all my intern season questions. My intern cohort also won the intern trivia event! I'll probably make some sort of blog post foucsing on my internship experience this year.

I think writing this blog will be fun and am looking forward to writing future posts. In the meantime, I will continue building my website so it is easier to navigate and doesn't look too bad:P Please reach out if you ever want to talk or have any questions. See you soon:]
