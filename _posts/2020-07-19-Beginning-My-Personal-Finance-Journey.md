Like many people during quarantine, I have decided to hop on Robinhood to try my hand at the stock market. Although the few stocks I have bought on the app won't have a large impact on my life, the process has kick-started my learning journey in personal finance.

The focus of this post will not be my specific strategies in the stock market or other passive income source ideas. It will be a few of the important guiding principles I have come across and hope to follow long term, and believe will help anyone maintain good financial health. I will briefly outline some more specific ideas that I subscribe to towards the end. I realize that I am incredibly fortunate to even think about building wealth, as some people are unfortunately unable to save or invest money while simultaneously supporting themselves and their families. This is especially prevalent during this global pandemic where unemployment rates have spiked. I know that this advice cannot apply to everyone, especially during these uncertain times.

**1. Establish an Emergency Fund**\\
I have learned that before investing money in anything, whether in the stock market, real estate, or anything else, it is important to have an emergency fund. This should ideally be at least 3-6 months (or more depending on your risk tolerance) of living expenses worth of money, easily accessible and non-volatile. A high-yield savings account is a good example of where to keep your emergency fund. It usually has an interest rate of 1-2%, which is much more than a classic savings account, but much less than the annual expected return of the stock market. However, since it is an **emergency** fund, keeping the money in the stock market would not be a good idea, as large fluctuations may occur when you need the money, resulting in loss. 

It is important to have this fund to fall back on if something unexpected comes up. For example, if you are laid off from your job, you have sufficient funds to support your life for a few months as you look for a new job. Or, if some unexpected medical expenses come up, you have some liquid money to afford treatment. Without an emergency fund, you would have to dip into any retirement savings accounts or other investment accounts to support yourself, which may currently be suffering from a volatile stock market. As a result, you would be withdrawing funds at a loss. 

Another reason to have an emergency fund is the idea that you should not be investing any money you are not willing to lose. Without an emergency fund, you definitely should not be investing all your surplus cash in the stock market. It may be tempting to use all your extra money to try and chase the huge gains Tesla's stock is making, but it is much wiser to first establish a backup to guard against TSLA suddenly dropping in value. One can argue whether you should be buying stocks like TSLA at all, but it is clear to me that you should not be willing to lose all the extra money from your paycheck in the stock market without any savings. 

**2. Live Below Your Means**\\
I have seen recommended savings rates of 10% of your income to much higher. Just because you make a certain amount of money does not mean you should spend that amount of money on rent, groceries, and other expenses. If possible, it is best not to live paycheck to paycheck, spending the last few days of your pay period struggling to make it to your next pay day. Just because you can afford it does not mean that you should get it. 

Some advice I really like is to pay yourself first. When budgeting, do not spend your money based on your total income. Instead, first account for the amount you put in your emergency fund, savings accounts, or investment accounts, then budget your life around the remaining income. By paying yourself first, you don't even see the money that you are saving at all; it is immediately diverted into your savings and investments. 

Also, it is important to avoid lifestyle creep. When you get a raise, that does not mean you can now spend more on rent, or buy more expensive food. It may be tempting to try living a more luxurious lifestyle one you start earning more money, but this is dangerous, as it is hard to go back to a more frugal lifestyle once you have acquired an expensive taste. This does not mean that you have to maintain the exact same standard of living; however, if you are comfortable with your living conditions already, there is no reason to spend more. Instead, you should think of the extra income as more opportunity to save and invest, and not to go overboard with other expenses.

**3. Start Early**\\
Starting early can really help you in the long run. I am not a math expert by any means, but I know the wonders of compound interest. The exponential growth can really increase your wealth over a longer period of time. If you start consistently investing in the stock market early, assuming an average annual return of around 7%, your early profits will also see that 7% gain year after year. On the other hand, starting later and holding for a shorter period of time will not reap the full benefits of compounding interest. As seen below, contributing $2000 a month for 20 years results in a significantly lower end balance than contributing $1000 a month for 40 years, despite the same personal contributions.

Like planting trees, the best time to start investing is 20 years ago. The second best time is now. The earlier you start, and the longer you allow your money to grow (depending on where you invest), the greater effect compound interest has on growth. Your retired self will definitely be thankful if you start investing early.

**4. Invest in Yourself**\\
Warren Buffet has famously said, "By far the best investment you can make is in yourself." I agree with that. This can include focusing on your health and wellness, learning throughout your entire life, and spending time with people that matter to you and raise you up. I'd rather be a decent person with knowledge and happiness than some miserable, ultra-rich goon. Go pay for a Capoeira class with Jairo if you are interested in the art. Go splurge a little on a hobby you enjoy that makes you happy. Go invest in an online class teaching a topic schools never could. 

Investing in yourself is different for everybody. I am not advocating for a specific investment like attending college (which I believe is worthwhile) or learning Afro-Brazilian martial arts. Find something that makes you tick, grow, and better yourself.

These are some of the main ideas I have brought to heart through starting my personal finance education journey. I didn't want to talk too much about specific investments or strategies, as I do not feel qualified to do so at this point. What I have listed here are ideas and goals that I believe can apply to anyone hoping to better their personal finance habits. I will briefly mention some specific beliefs I tend to lean towards. One is the [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started){:target="_blank"} investing philosophy, which focuses on sticking to a simple plan of investing in index funds without trying to time the stock market. Trying to pick stocks seems like gambling to me, as it seems unpredictable. I do not have enough knowledge at the moment to intelligently pick stocks, and am not willing to unnecessarily risk my money on stocks to chase large short term profits. I also really value education, and believe college is worth it for most people. If you cannot afford it, absolutely despise it, or have alternative plans in place, then it's worthwhile to pursue other paths. But for most people, the education, experience, and connections are worth it.
