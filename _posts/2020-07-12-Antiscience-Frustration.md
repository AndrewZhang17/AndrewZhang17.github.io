I usually don't talk about or post on social media too much about politics. However, science is objectively not political, yet has somehow been been turned into some kind of political enemy in the United States. Can we please use some sense so we can all go outside safely at some point?

I realize that science doesn't always produce claims or results that are 100% accurate, and is often not objective. But that contributes to the merit of science. Our scientific ideas are always changing due to the scientific method. We test old theories and hypotheses, conduct experiments, and observe result, and we can either alter our previous beliefs or strengthen their truth. There are rarely ever certainties, but if an overwhelming majority of qualified individuals support some idea, it is probably in our best interest to believe it is correct. 

During this global pandemic, I struggle to understand why so many people refuse to where masks and abide by lockdown rules. So many health professionals and organizations have explained the severity and dangers of this virus, as well as the steps the general public can take to prevent, or at least slow its spread. Yet somehow, the United States is seeing increasing, record-breaking numbers of new cases almost every day. Wearing masks, which has been advised by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html){:target="_blank"}, [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public){:target="_blank"}, and [scientific publications](http://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf){:target="_blank"}, has somehow become a political weapon of our current government. It has been portrayed as an attempt to limit people's freedom when it should be seen as a simple measure to save a disproportional number lives. 

I simply do not understand how so many people, including those at the top of our government, are so willing to diregard science in an attempt to attack their political enemies. At this point, I don't know if these government officials actually know the consequences of their words and actions and are just appealing to those who support them, or if they genuinely don't believe the science being presented to them. The current administration clearly doesn't care about the well being of the people, so it could definitely be either option. 

I've tried to look up why people may not trust science on the internet, and have [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2u3jk9/eli5_why_is_there_an_antiscience_movement_in_the/co4se1l/){:target="_blank"} that other people have found the same frustration way before this pandemic. Some suggest that science may be in direct opposition to religious beliefs. I am not religious, but do not usually see religions as some of brain-washing cults, but certain ideas I have seen in my life are hard to understand. A popular one is evolution. I understand that some Christians believe that humans are created by God and not the product of billions of years of evolution. With so much evidence of evolution and natural selection, and no solid evidence of creationism, how could one not believe in evolution?

I definitely do not oppose religion in its entirety. I see no problem as using religion as some kind of guide for your life, holding you accountable for your actions or giving life purpose. In fact, there may be some higher being that will punish me for eternity for not believing. The problem I have is when people blindly follow texts or sayings that directly hinder growth of knowledge or hurt other people simply because they can't accept change or different perspectives.

Obviously, there are other reasons to for one to oppose scientific facts, but I don't think I would see any of these reasons as valid due to the inherently evidence based approach of science. Once again, I know science does not always produce correct results. We *used to* think the Earth was flat. We used to think the Earth was the center of the universe. Science allows for growth and change. Our knowledge is built on the shoulders of giants. 

Please just wear a mask. I want to go outside:'[
